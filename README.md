# ElecDev Graphics Application

This is the graphics application that is to be used with the ElecDev software.  It is built to be a standalone executable that can interface with Excel.

### Software And Dependencies

* Language: C++, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B].  
* GUI Library: ImGUI, [https://github.com/ocornut/imgui].  This project uses the docking branch.  
* Graphics Backend: OpenGL, [https://www.opengl.org//].  
* GLFW (Window): [https://www.glfw.org/].  
* OpenGL Loader (GLAD): [https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Loading_Library#glad_.28Multi-Language_GL.2FGLES.2FEGL.2FGLX.2FWGL_Loader-Generator.29], [https://glad.dav1d.de/].
* OpenGL Maths (GLM): [https://github.com/g-truc/glm].
* Must have program for debugging graphics, [https://renderdoc.org/].

*Note: The ImGUI docs can be found in the ImGUI.h file, it is not online or on the Git repo!*

### OpenGL Learning Resources

* LearnOpenGL: [https://learnopengl.com/Introduction].
* The Cherno: [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject]. The best one!
* Udemy course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/].  Only buy the courses when they are on discount!
* OpenGL Docs: [http://docs.gl/]. Very handy to check functions, versions and deprecations.
* Also has an OpenGL course: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkRj4qoT1bsWpE_C8lZYoQ].
* Also good: [https://www.youtube.com/c/OGLDEV/featured].

***IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use Legacy OpenGL, only use Modern OpenGL!*

## Fixing & Improving

#### Alex
* ⬜ Mouse events are handled by making the GraphicsHandler object global.  Find another way.
* 🟨 Seperate OpenGL drawing and window events on different threads (Resizing not working properly).
* ⬜ OpenGL has a offset that cannot be removed (can be seen in AutoCAD).  Find a way to fix this.
* ⬜ Unbinding is not necessary and costs performance, but helpful for debugging.  Write code so that it unbinds in debug mode but does not do it in release mode.
* 🟨 GL_LINES & GL_TRIANGLES are being used instead of GL_LINE_LOOP & GL_TRIANGLE_FAN.  Unsure if this will have an impact on performance.  Might just be the use of predefined IBO's.
* ✅ Use the docking branch from ImGUI.
* ✅ Use less draw calls by using less buffers.  Only draw lines and triangles.  Will make buffer management more complex.
* ⬜ Combine basic, textured and text rendering (VAO's and shaders) to reduce draw calls and shader switching.
* ⬜ Currently using an older version of the ImGUI docking banch, because they implemented an OpenGL loader that conflicts with GLAD.  Find out why this is a problem and fix.
* ⬜ Error handler uses deprecated OpenGL functions that causes problems on GPU's that does not have good compatibility.  Replace with another handler (glDebugMessageCallback?).
* ✅ Implement "Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects" from paper [https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf].
* ⬜ Font rendering is done with .fnt & .png files.  This works, but using .ttf files is more modern.  The fist option is used since it is faster to work with a font atlas.
* ⬜ TextRenderer file parsing is hard coded for one specific file.  This has to be fixed.
* ✅ Type casts throwing warning.  Fix.
* ✅ Buffer sizes are currently static, change to dynamic.
* ✅ Use SDF (Signed Distance Fields) when rendering text.
* ✅ Create a resource loader function.
* ✅ Fix abstractions.  Code got messy when we started rushing.
* ✅ Autoresize and scaling does not take into account the length of the text string.
* ⬜ Looks like there is some kind of memory leak when resizing the window.
* ⬜ Add text kerning.
* ⬜ Move over to smart pointers for better memory management.
* ⬜ Fix cursor position calculation with text in the text renderer.
* ⬜ Fix naming convention.
* ✅ Enable MSAA for the FBO.
* ✅ Move CPU data handling over to VAO class.
* ⬜ What happens when deltaTime() gets called twice in the same frame in the camera handler?
* ⬜ Make the circle resolution dynamic, a function of the radius.
* ⬜ Fix shader uniform caching.
* ⬜ Make function calling in the GraphicsAPI generic (use function pointers?).

#### Raynhardt 
* ✅ Multi View port
* ✅ Multi vieport docking
* ⬜ Resize event need working on
* ✅ Implement Input catching
* ✅ Rebuild IO handling

#### Bugs from Ulrich
* ✅ The MCC must open in the middle of the window.
* ⬜ If a lot of drawings are drawn, the last drawing is not completely finished. I do not know the reason for this, but if I draw a new MCC the old one is drawn completely.
* ⬜ I cannot resize the windows of the drawings.
* ✅ I want to be able to close a drawing window (per MCC).
